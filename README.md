# Course Description
Business analytics is a set of data analysis and modeling techniques for understanding business situations and improving business decisions.  This course provides an introduction to business analytics concepts, methods and tools with concrete examples from industry applications. In the first part of the course, we will focus on data analysis concepts and understanding data with a refresher on basic probability and statistics. In the second part, we will cover the principles and techniques for data visualization to improve comprehension, communication, and decision-making. The final part of the course will introduce the basic principles and techniques of applied mathematical modeling for managerial decision making with an emphasis on optimization models that are widely used in diverse industries and functional areas, including finance, marketing, and operations. Finally, throughout the course, we explore the challenges that can arise in implementing analytical approaches within an organization.
 
The course emphasizes that business analytics is not a theoretical discipline: these techniques are only interesting and important to the extent that they can be used to provide real insights and improve the speed, reliability, and quality of decisions.
